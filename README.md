# PredatorPreyMultiAgent ![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/DavidLSmyth/PredatorPreyMultiAgent.svg?branch=master)
An example of a multi-agent system

Currently a work in progress. The idea is to have a grid environment on which predators and prey exists. The predators can autonomously hunt the prey by implementing various strategies. Eventually Predators will work together to form a multi-agent system.
